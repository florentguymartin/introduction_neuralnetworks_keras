PyData_talk
==============================

Project for a talk about feedforward neural networks using Python, and in particular Keras (PyData Munich Meetups March 2018).
It uses the iris dataset.

The talk consists of the following [jupyter notebook](./notebooks/talk-nn-keras.ipynb) which was conceived to be run with [RISE](http://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The figures used in the notebook can be found in [./figures/img/](./figures/img/) and were generated  using Latex or matplotlib with source files which are in [./figures/src/](./figures/src/).


To run the notebook faster some datas are in [./data/](./data/)
